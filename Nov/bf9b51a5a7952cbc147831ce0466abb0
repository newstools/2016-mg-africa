Journalists from the privately-owned media in Malawi have warned President Peter Mutharika of a medical blackout if he continues to &#8220;insult&#8221; journalists. According to BBC, Mutharika recently described the media as &#8220;disgusting&#8221;, saying it was peddling &#8220;nonsense and garbage&#8221;. Journalists in the southern African country also complained about the slow progress through parliament of an Access to Information bill. Early this year Mutharika urged the church to join in his war against social media, claiming that the communication medium was the cause of &#8220;social decay&#8221; in his country. The Malawian leader urged the church at the time to help government in its fight against the &#8220;abuse&#8221; of social media. Mutharika said that the &#8220;abuse&#8221; of the medium would lead to the &#8220;degeneration of values and morals&#8221; within the country. The government made an announcement in May that it would draft new cyber laws to control the use of social media within the country. The Information Minister Jappie Mhango was at the time quoted as saying that the bill would impose harsh punishment for &#8220;abusers&#8221; of social media platforms. &mdash;&nbsp;news24
