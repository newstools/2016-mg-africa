Nigerian Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka has said that he would be leaving the US on the day president-elect Donald Trump is inaugurated in 2017, the BBC reported on Thursday.Soyinka vowed a week ago while giving a speech to students at the Oxford University in the United Kingdom that he would &#8220;cut up&#8221; his green card if Trump won the elections.Following queries by social media users asking him about his promise, the author replied: &#8220;Come January 20, 2017; watch my WOLEXIT!&#8221;He said that he was biding his time until January 20, 2017 when Trump takes the Oval office.&#8220;Why don t we wait until Trump actually takes office? I m just going about my normal commitments, but definitely not getting into any more commitments. Let s put it that way for now,&#8221; Soyinka was quoted as saying.&#8216;Not my president&#8217; Soyinka is currently a scholar-in-residence at New York University s Institute of African American Affairs.During his speech last week, Soyinka said it was highly &#8220;unlikely that Trump would win the upcoming elections&#8221;. However, he cautioned, if Trump did, the &#8220;first thing he ll do is to say [that] all green card holders must reapply to come into the US.&#8220;Well, I am not waiting for that. The moment they announce his victory, I will cut my green card myself and start packing up,&#8221; Soyinka was quoted as saying at the time. Following Trump&#8217;s surprise win yesterday, citizens around the US took to the streets in protest, voicing their dissent with a rallying cry of &#8220;Not my president&#8221;. There was a mixed response from markets, with some reacting positively while others dipped. News 24
