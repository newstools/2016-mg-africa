COMMENT Fidel Castro, the Cuban revolutionary leader who died on Friday November 25 at the age of 90, is arguably one of the most beloved world leaders in Africa. This is mainly due to Cuba&#8217;s contribution during anti-colonial and anti-apartheid struggles in African countries such as South Africa, Namibia, Angola, Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau. In addition, Cuba trained many African doctors and sent its own doctors into African countries. The most recent example of Cuban doctors helping out in Africa was during the Ebola crisis when the country sent about 300 doctors. Immediately after the official announcement of his death, African leaders and ordinary citizens took to Twitter to pay tribute to the communist icon.&nbsp; Nigeria&#8217;s president Muhammadu Buhari tweeted: Fidel Castro was a great friend to Africa, to countries in the Global South and to the Non-Aligned Movement.
