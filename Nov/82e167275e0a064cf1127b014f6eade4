COMMENT Will Donald Trump&#8217;s shock #USElection2016 win mean Zimbabwe&#8217;s Robert Mugabe is headed for victory again in 2018? Forget #BondNotes and bungling prophets, this is the question at the back of many Zimbabweans&#8217; minds as they digest the news of a victory many did not see coming.Here&#8217;s a look at the some of the Zimbabwean reaction to Trump&#8217;s win:Mugabe &amp; Co: What are they saying? As of midday, Mugabe has not publicly reacted. (That doesn&#8217;t mean he&#8217;s not pleased: it may just mean he&#8217;s up late. There has been at least one call for someone to &#8220;wake up the Prez&#8221; for a reaction). Jonathan Moyo, Mugabe&#8217;s ex-spin doctor, seemed pretty pleased with a Trump win: he talked about Trump &#8220;shaming and sending liberals into hiding&#8221;. Moyo also said Hillary Clinton had co-sponsored ZIDERA, the US Congress Act passed in 2001 that allowed for the suspension of budgetary support to Zimbabwe.Zanu-PF MP Psychology Maziwisa told the state ZBC&#8217;s lunchtime news bulletin that Trump&#8217;s win was &#8220;particularly good for Zimbabwe&#8221;. On the same programme, the editor of the pro-Mugabe Herald newspaper Caesar Zvayi said Clinton had &#8220;blood on her hands&#8221;.The ex-editor of the state Chronicle, Mduduzi Mathuthu opted for a cautiously optimistic tweet: &#8220;[Trump] could turn out great you know.&#8221;So Mugabe supporters are pro-Trump, MDC supporters pro-Clinton. Is that it? Yes and no. There was certainly a lot of disappointment among well-known critics of Mugabe at the Trump win. As the inevitability of a Trump win dawned, advocate Fadzayi Mahere asked on Twitter whether there wasn&#8217;t a diaspora on Mars to go to. Author Pettina Gappah said: &#8220;This just cannot be.&#8221; As for Zimbabwean publisher Trevor Ncube, he reached for a drink &mdash; something stronger than coffee, according to his timeline.But reactions can&#8217;t be totally explained along MDC/Zanu-PF lines. Well-known lawyer and analyst Alex Magaisa talked of an &#8220;anti-establishment win&#8221;. Broadcaster and talkshow host Zororo Makamba reminded his followers that he&#8217;d predicted a Trump win earlier this year because &#8220;voters are irrational and vote based on emotion&#8221;. That will ring bells to many Zimbabweans looking back to the 2013 elections: how many voters ticked the Mugabe box because cancelled years of accumulated rates&#8217; bills? Or because Tsvangirai&#8217;s messy love life and political miscalculations made him someone they couldn&#8217;t look up to?Could a Trump win affect #Bondnotes? Since #bondnotes are big on Zimbabwean minds at the moment, it was only to be expected they&#8217;d figure in the discussion. These unpopular notes are likely to be introduced before the year is out and Zimbabwe&#8217;s central bank says they&#8217;ll be on a par with the US. So: if the US dollar loses in value on the back of a Trump win, does that mean that one bond note will be worth more than a US dollar, as one Zimbabwean asked? That&#8217;s unlikely, since the bond note is predicted to devalue the moment it hits the market. Media entrepreneur Nigel Mugamu tweeted a valid concern though: &#8220;What if someone uses [the devaluation of the US] to justify introduction of #BondNotes?&#8221;Does this mean Mugabe will win in 2018? There are certainly parallels between Trump&#8217;s win and Mugabe&#8217;s last victory back in 2013. Overly-complacent, the main MDC believed then that voters had no choice but to recognise and reward the positive gains made under the power-sharing government that had been in place since 2009. But voters didn&#8217;t.Discount the rigging and the bussing-in of voters and you still get the inescapable fact that many in Zimbabwe&#8217;s great rural heartlands (and beyond) still voted for the then nearly 90-year-old who promised jobs and fulminated against gays, journalists and &#8220;illegal Western sanctions&#8221;.Will these voters vote for Mugabe again in 2018 (if he&#8217;s still alive)? Quite possibly. &mdash;&nbsp;News24
