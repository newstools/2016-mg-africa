US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has blasted Somali refugees, saying that they are “bringing extremist views” to the US. According to BBC, Trump, who was speaking during his last round of campaigning in Minnesota, vowed that his administration would not allow any refugees “without the support and consent of local communities”. “How stupid are our leaders? How stupid are they to allow this to happen? Here in Minnesota you have seen first-hand the problems with faulty refugee vetting with large numbers of Somali refugees coming into your state without your knowledge. Without your support or approval,” said the property mogul. @realDonaldTrump says Minnesota “has suffered enough” due to Somali refugees https://t.co/c7leuCE9uR https://t.co/MtV9bhhahn — ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) November 6, 2016 The bruising and unpredictable race that concludes on November 8 has gripped the world and roiled international markets, as Americans decide whether to elect their first female commander-in-chief or a billionaire real estate tycoon whose political inexperience is seen by some as an asset and others a liability. Prophet predicts a win for ClintonAccording to an earlier report, Nigerian prophet TB Joshua of the Synagogue Church of Nations predicted that Hillary Clinton will win the election in a “narrow victory”. He made the disclosure while speaking to a packed congregation on Sunday. TB Joshua prophesied that the female candidate would win the coveted position and shared his “vision” on his Facebook page, which is followed by over 2.5-million people. “Ten days ago, I saw the new president of America with a narrow win,” said Joshua. He, however, also lauded Trump: “I want to salute the opposition – a very strong man and courageous. “He is my friend because he is very, very courageous.
