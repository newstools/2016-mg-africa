A VERVET&nbsp;monkey triggered a nationwide blackout in Kenya after it fell onto a transformer at one of the nation s main hydroelectric plants, Kenya Electricity Generating Co. said, setting off a frenzied morning of Twitter jokes.&nbsp;The monkey climbed on to the roof of the Gitaru facility and may have been thrown off balance and onto a transformer, tripping the equipment and causing an overload on other machines at the plant, according to a statement e-mailed by the Nairobi-based power generator, known as KenGen.&nbsp;The animal survived the incident, it said.&nbsp;The primate accessed the plant even though KenGen s facilities are secured by electric fences designed to keep out marauding wild animals, the company said. KenGen supplies 80% of the electricity in East Africa s biggest economy.&nbsp;The incident resulted in the loss of more than 180 megawatts from the plant, setting off the blackout, according to the utility. Supply has since been restored and power-generating units are operating normally, it said.The explanation fired up Kenyan&nbsp;Twitterdom with a flood of&nbsp;memes.-Bloomberg
