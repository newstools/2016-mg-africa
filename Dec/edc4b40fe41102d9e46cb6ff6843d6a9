Opposition leader Nana Akufo-Addo of the New Patriotic Party (NPP) won Ghana&#8217;s presidency on December 7 standing as a candidate for the third time. Akufo-Addo got 53.85% of the votes in the election, while outgoing President John Mahama got 44.4%.In a continent where elections are often marred by violence, rigging, election-day internet shutdowns and other irregularities, the peaceful nature of Ghana&#8217;s election cemented its position as a beacon of democracy in Africa. The international community has praised the country for the way the elections were managed.Just recently, Gambia&#8217;s president Yahya Jammeh, who has been in power for 22 years,rejected the election result, after he was defeated by opposition leader Adam Barrow.Only days before he spoke out against supposed irregularities, he had accepted his defeat and phoned Barrow to congratulate him on his victory, informing him that he bore no ill will . Apparently, he had a change of heart.Echoing similar sentiments, Kenyan lawyer Chris Mwangi tweeted:Ghana is consistently one of those African countries that gives the western media nothing negative to report about Africa.#GhanaDecides&mdash; Chris Mwangi (@Mwangixtopher) December 8, 2016 He was not completely right, though, as Gary Al-Smith pointed out:Uhm @CNN, I didn&#8217;t know Ghanaians &#8220;stand in long lines to obtain products&#8221; or &#8220;struggle to obtain food&#8221;.
