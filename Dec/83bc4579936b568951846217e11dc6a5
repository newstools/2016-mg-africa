Gambian President Yahya Jammeh faces the biggest threat to his 22-year rule as the 880,000 Gambians eligible to vote head to the polls following two weeks of unprecedented rallies by an energised opposition.The country&#8217;s 1400 polling stations opened at 08:00 GMT on Thursday for an election overshadowed by an internet blackout, a protest ban and accusations of vote rigging.The winner will serve a five-year term in Gambia, a tiny former British colony in west Africa that occupies a narrow sliver of land surrounded by French-speaking Senegal. READ MORE: The Gambia&#8217;s Jammeh unlikely to be unseated at the polls tomorrowJammeh is running for a fifth term in office with his ruling Alliance for Patriotic Reorientation and Construction (APRC).He faces previously unknown estate agent, Adama Barrow, chosen as a flagbearer by seven Gambian political parties and an independent candidate who have joined forces for the first time to form a coalition with unprecedented support.If Barrow were to win - a tall order both in terms of votes and the likelihood of Jammeh giving up power - he would likely serve a three-year term at the head of a transitional reform government.A third candidate, former ruling party MP Mama Kandeh, is also standing for the Gambian Democratic Congress (GDC). Protests would not be toleratedAt his final rally on Tuesday night, Jammeh said he was looking forward to ramping up development in a country that &#8220;will move faster than it has in 22 years&#8221;, but he also warned that protests over Thursday&#8217;s result would not be tolerated.Gambia&#8217;s unique voting system, which sees citizens vote by dropping a marble into a coloured drum for their candidate, could not be rigged, he added, meaning &#8220;there is no reason for anybody to protest&#8221;.Rights group Amnesty International urged the authorities to ensure that the election and post-electoral period &#8220;are held in a climate that is free from violence and which fully respects the right of all people to freely express their views&#8221;.
