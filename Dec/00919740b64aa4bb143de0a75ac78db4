Maxence Melo, co-founder of Tanzanian whistleblowing and discussion site Jamii Forums was arrested in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania on December 13, for refusing police requests for forum members personal data. The offices of Jamii Forums were&nbsp;raided by police on December 14, and multiple other staff were questioned.The charges against Melo fall under Tanzania&#8217;s relatively new and controversial Cybercrimes Law which has been used to prosecute numerous social media users since its approval in 2015.READ MORE: How African governments are increasingly clamping down on the internet to control their citizenry Jamii Forums, which was established in 2006 by Maxence Melo and Mike Mushi, is one of the most popular sites in East Africa. Jamii (Swahili for community ) Forums is known for intense political discussions and revelations of corruption that take place on its comment and discussion threads, in a style similar to that of Reddit. Melo has periodically faced challenges from&nbsp;state and federal authorities since the early days of Jamii Forums, where various corruption allegations against government officials and ruling party members have surfaced.One of Melo&#8217;s six lawyers, Benedict Ishabakaki, says his arrest and detention follow a High Court case, brought by Melo, that asks the court to review sections of Tanzania&#8217;s 2015 Cybercrimes Law that allow extensive powers of law enforcement officers to search and seize electronic devices and computer systems.&nbsp;Beyond declining to disclose user data that authorities have requested under the Cybercrimes Law Melo argues that they are unconstitutional and that the Cybercrimes Law undercuts freedom of expression in Tanzania. He and his staff have also asserted that Jamii Forums&nbsp;store user data in an encrypted format, on servers located outside the country.READ MORE: Cameroon launches campaign against social media, calling it &#8216;a new form of terrorism&#8217;After spending 3 nights in detention, Melo was taken to Kisutu Magistrate Court on the morning of December 16.

He will appear in court on Monday.Free speech activists, multiple media and human rights organisations have all come out in support of Melo, including the Collaboration on International ICT Policy for East and Southern Africa, the Committee to Protect Journalists, Legal and Human Right Centre, Tanzania Editors Forum and Tanzania Human Right Defenders Coalition.Twitter users in Tanzania and outside are voicing their opposition to his arrest using the hashtag #FreeMaxenceMelo.Defending the site, Tanzanian communications expert, Maria Sarungi Tsehai, said:Honest feedback is important for any government and whistleblowing sites are crucial in the fight against corruption #FreeMaxenceMelo&mdash; Maria Sarungi Tsehai (@MariaSTsehai) December 15, 2016 Another user wondered why in other jurisdictions such as the US refusal to reveal users data does not lead to arrest.
